```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
```

## Problem 1

This problem uses the BRFSS data; we will load this data the following way:

```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data(brfss_smart2010)
```

Then we need to do the following cleaning steps: 1) format the data to use appropriate variable names 2) focus on the “Overall Health” topic
3) include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor” 4) organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Excellent” to “Poor”.
